# nvim

Configuration files and custom modules for Neovim.

This config has a decent amount of work and is basically a fully fledged IDE.  Why didn't I use [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim), [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) or [SpaceVim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim)?  I like doing things myself.

> ℹ️ &nbsp; I try to keep all of the key bindings in [one file](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nvim/blob/main/lua/alex/keymaps/init.lua).  So if you want to use the configs, this is the only file you have to familiarise yourself with.  You can add more LSPs to the end of [this file](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nvim/blob/main/lua/alex/lang/lsp/clients.lua).
