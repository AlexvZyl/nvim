# $HOME/.config/nvim

Configuration files and custom modules for Neovim.  This is a submodule for my [Linux](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles) and [MacOS](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles-macos) dotfiles.

This config has a decent amount of work and is basically a fully fledged IDE.  Why didn't I use [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim), [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) or [SpaceVim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim)?  I like doing things myself.

> [!NOTE]
> I am not setting up my packages in the way that is described by `lazy.nvim`.  I am trying to keep my configs "package-manager-agnostic" as far as possible.
>
> I try to keep all of the key bindings in [one file](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nvim/blob/main/lua/alex/keymaps/init.lua) so that it is easier to keep track of everything and prevent conflicts.
